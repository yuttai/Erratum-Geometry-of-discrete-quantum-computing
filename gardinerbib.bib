  Abstract                 = {We explore finite-field frameworks for quantum theory and quantum computation. The simplest theory, defined over unrestricted finite fields, is unnaturally strong. A second framework employs only finite fields with no solution to x 2 + 1 = 0, and thus permits an elegant complex representation of the extended field by adjoining ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1751-8121/47/11/115305/jpa485335ieqn1.gif] {${\rm i}=\sqrt{-1}$} . Quantum theories over these fields recover much of the structure of conventional quantum theory except for the condition that vanishing inner products arise only from null states; unnaturally strong computational power may still occur. Finally, we are led to consider one more framework, with further restrictions on the finite fields, that recovers a local transitive order and a locally-consistent notion of inner product with a new notion of cardinal probability . In this framework, conventional quantum mechanics and quantum computation emerge locally (though not globally) as the size of the underlying field increases. Interestingly, the framework allows one to choose separate finite fields for system description and for measurement: the size of the first field quantifies the resources needed to describe the system and the size of the second quantifies the resources used by the observer. This resource-based perspective potentially provides insights into quantitative measures for actual computational power, the complexity of quantum system definition and evolution, and the independent question of the cost of the measurement process.},

  Abstract                 = {Conventional quantum computing entails a geometry based on the description of an n -qubit state using 2 n infinite precision complex numbers denoting a vector in a Hilbert space. Such numbers are in general uncomputable using any real-world resources, and, if we have the idea of physical law as some kind of computational algorithm of the universe, we would be compelled to alter our descriptions of physics to be consistent with computable numbers. Our purpose here is to examine the geometric implications of using finite fields F p and finite complexified fields ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1751-8121/46/18/185301/jpa453851ieqn1.gif] {$\mathbf {F}_{p^2}$} (based on primes p congruent to 3 ( mod 4)) as the basis for computations in a theory of discrete quantum computing, which would therefore become a computable theory. Because the states of a discrete n -qubit system are in principle enumerable, we are able to determine the proportions of entangled and unentangled states. In particular, we extend the Hopf fibration that defines the irreducible state space of conventional continuous n -qubit theories (which is the complex projective space ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1751-8121/46/18/185301/jpa453851ieqn2.gif] {$\mathbf {CP}^{2^{n}-1}$} ) to an analogous discrete geometry in which the Hopf circle for any n is found to be a discrete set of p + 1 points. The tally of unit-length n -qubit states is given, and reduced via the generalized Hopf fibration to ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1751-8121/46/18/185301/jpa453851ieqn3.gif] {$\mathbf {DCP}^{2^{n}-1}$} , the discrete analogue of the complex projective space, which has ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1751-8121/46/18/185301/jpa453851ieqn4.gif] {$p^{2^{n}-1} (p-1)\,\prod _{k=1}^{n-1} ( p^{2^{k}}+1)$} irreducible states. Using a measure of entanglement, the purity , we explore the entanglement features of discrete quantum states and find that the n -qubit states based on the complexified field ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/1751-8121/46/18/185301/jpa453851ieqn5.gif] {$\mathbf {F}_{p^2}$} have p n ( p ??1) n unentangled states (the product of the tally for a single qubit) with purity 1, and they have p n + 1 ( p ??1)( p + 1) n ??1 maximally entangled states with purity zero.},
