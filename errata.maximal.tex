For maximally entangled states, the purity calculation in conventional
quantum mechanics using equation~(27) produces 0. Given the above
observations, in a discrete field, equation~(27) may be undefined
or may report a purity of 0 even for partially entangled states. For
example, the normalized state $\ket{\Psi}=\left(1-\rmi\right)\left(\ket{00}+\ket{11}\right)\otimes\ket{000}$
has $P_{\fh}=0$ for $p=3$, and is not maximally entangled because
only the first two qubits are entangled. In the discrete case, we
therefore check for maximally entangled states using the following
equation, 
\begin{equation}
\forall j,\forall\mu,\braket{\sigma_{\mu}^{j}}^{2}=0\textrm{ ,}\label{eq:john}
\end{equation}
which avoids the normalization factor and simply checks that each
summand is 0.
