\maketitle

\noindent Section~5.4 of our paper~\cite{geometry} requires a clarification and a correction.

\paragraph*{Clarification: Unentangled vs.\ product states.}
In conventional quantum mechanics, using the field of complex numbers, a state is unentangled when it can be expressed as a product state or, equivalently, when equation~(27) reports its purity to be 1~\cite{PhysRevLett.92.107902, PhysRevA.68.032308}. When using finite Galois fields $\ff{p^2}$, for particular choices of $p$, it is possible for equation~(27) to produce a purity of 1 for some entangled states. For example, the normalized entangled state $\ket{\Psi} = \ket{011}+\left(2+\rmi\right)\ket{100}+\ket{101}+\ket{110}$ has $P_{\fh}=1$ for $p=7$. In addition, the process of determining whether a \emph{given} state $\ket{\Phi}$ is a product state may depend on $p$. 

Thus, in finite fields, the simplest way to calculate the number of
unentangled states is to disregard equation~(27) and count the number
of product states. This is exactly how the counting in section~5.4
was done, but the paper did not point out that counting relying only on equation~(27) might not lead to the same result.

\paragraph*{Correction: Maximally entangled states.}
We present below a new version of section~5.4 that correctly counts maximally entangled states. The rest of the article is independent of this revision.

\subsection{Maximal entanglement}

In conventional quantum mechanics, a state $\ket{\Psi}$ is maximally entangled
when equation~(27) reports its purity to be 0. Therefore, in the discrete case,
states whose computed purity is a multiple of the field characteristic $p$ will be
incorrectly labeled as maximally entangled by equation~(27). This occurs trivially when $n ~|~ p$. 






For example, consider
the normalized $n=3$-qubit product state $\ket{\Psi}$ over $\ff{3^{2}}$:
\[
\ket{\Psi}=\ket{0}\otimes\left(\ket{0}-\ket{1}\right)\otimes\left(\ket{0}-\ket{1}\right)\textrm{ .}
\]
In this case the quantity $n P_{\fh} = 3 P_{\fh} = 0$

%% , where 
%% \[
%% \overline{P_{\fh}}=\sum_{j=1}^{n}\sum_{\mu=x,y,z}\left\langle 
%% \sigma_{\mu}^{j}\right\rangle ^{2}\textrm{ .}
%% \]

In the continuous case, the zero purity actually means every summand is
$0$, i.e., 
\begin{equation}
\forall j,\forall\mu,\braket{\sigma_{\mu}^{j}}=0\textrm{ .}\label{eq:john}
\end{equation}
Because equation (\ref{eq:john}) avoids wrapping around when adding
expectation values, it defines maximally entangled states over finite
fields.


Computing some examples for various $n$ and small values of $p$,
one can verify explicitly that unit-norm product states for $n=2$,
$p=\{3,7,11,19,\ldots\}$ occur with frequency 
\[
(p+1)p^{2}(p-1)^{2}=\{144,14\,112,145\,200,2339\,280,\ldots\}\ ,
\]
and for general $n$, $(p+1)p^{n}(p-1)^{n}$.

The irreducible state counts are reduced by $(p+1)$, giving 
\[
p^{2}(p-1)^{2}=\{36,1764,12\,100,116\,964,\ldots\}\ ,
\]
and in general for $n$-qubits, there are $p^{n}\left(p-1\right)^{n}$
instances of product pure states.

Repeating the computation, we find maximally entanglement states with
frequencies for two qubits of 
\[
p\left(p-1\right)\left(p+1\right)^{2}=\left\{ 96,2688,15\,840,136\,800,\ldots\right\} \ .
\]
The irreducible state counts for maximal entanglement are reduced
by $\left(p+1\right)$, giving for $n=2$ 
\[
p\left(p^{2}-1\right)=\left\{ 24,336,1320,6840,\ldots\right\} \ .
\]
For three-qubits, there are $p^{3}\left(p^{4}-1\right)\left(p+1\right)$
instances of pure maximally entangled states, while the general formula
for four-qubit states remains unclear.

\ack{}{We would like to thank John Gardiner for pointing out the
need for this correction.}
