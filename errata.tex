\maketitle

\noindent Section~5.4 of our paper~\cite{geometry} requires a clarification
and a correction.

\paragraph*{Clarification: Unentangled vs. product states.}

In conventional quantum mechanics, using the real and complex numbers,
a state is unentangled when it can be expressed as a product state
or when equation~(27) reports its purity to be 1. When using finite
fields, it is possible for equation~(27) to produce a purity of 1
for some entangled states. For example, a normalized entangled state
$\ket{011}+\left(-2-\rmi\right)\ket{100}+\ket{101}+\ket{110}$ has
$P_{\fh}=1$ over $\ff{7^{2}}$.


Thus, in finite fields, the simplest way to calculate the number of
unentangled states is to ignore equation~(27) and to count the number
of product states. This is exactly how the counting in section~5.4
was produced, but the paper did not clarify that counting using equation~(27)
would be incorrect.


\paragraph*{Correction: Maximally entangled states.}

We correct the definition and the counting of maximally entangled
states, and add equation~(\ref{eq:john}). The corrected version
of section~5.4 below has no influence on the rest of the article. 


\subsection{Maximal entanglement}

In conventional quantum mechanics, a state is maximally entangled
when equation~(27) reports its purity to be 0. In the discrete case,
states whose purity is a multiple of the field characteristic are
incorrectly labeled as maximally entangled. For example, consider
a normalized 3-qubit product state $\ket{\Psi_{1}}$ over $\ff{3^{2}}$:
\[
\ket{\Psi_{1}}=\ket{0}\otimes\left(\ket{0}-\ket{1}\right)\otimes\left(\ket{0}-\ket{1}\right)\textrm{ .}
\]
In this case the re-scaled purity $\overline{P_{\fh}}=0$, where 
\[
\overline{P_{\fh}}=\sum_{j=1}^{n}\sum_{\mu=x,y,z}\left\langle \sigma_{\mu}^{j}\right\rangle ^{2}\textrm{ .}
\]


In continuous case, the zero purity actually means every summand is
$0$, i.e., 
\begin{equation}
\forall j,\forall\mu,\braket{\sigma_{\mu}^{j}}=0\textrm{ .}\label{eq:john}
\end{equation}
Because equation (\ref{eq:john}) avoids wrapping around when adding
expectation values, it defines maximally entangled states over finite
fields.


Computing some examples for various $n$ and small values of $p$,
one can verify explicitly that unit-norm product states for $n=2$,
$p=\{3,7,11,19,\ldots\}$ occur with frequency 
\[
(p+1)p^{2}(p-1)^{2}=\{144,14\,112,145\,200,2339\,280,\ldots\}\ ,
\]
and for general $n$, $(p+1)p^{n}(p-1)^{n}$.

The irreducible state counts are reduced by $(p+1)$, giving 
\[
p^{2}(p-1)^{2}=\{36,1764,12\,100,116\,964,\ldots\}\ ,
\]
and in general for $n$-qubits, there are $p^{n}\left(p-1\right)^{n}$
instances of product pure states.

Repeating the computation, we find maximally entanglement states with
frequencies for two qubits of 
\[
p\left(p-1\right)\left(p+1\right)^{2}=\left\{ 96,2688,15\,840,136\,800,\ldots\right\} \ .
\]
The irreducible state counts for maximal entanglement are reduced
by $\left(p+1\right)$, giving for $n=2$ 
\[
p\left(p^{2}-1\right)=\left\{ 24,336,1320,6840,\ldots\right\} \ .
\]
For three-qubits, there are $p^{3}\left(p^{4}-1\right)\left(p+1\right)$
instances of pure maximally entangled states, while the general formula
for four-qubit states remains unclear.

\ack{}{We would like to thank John Gardiner for pointing out the
need for this correction.}
